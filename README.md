# Semester 6 Projects

This repository contains **team projects** I contributed to and **individual projects** completed during **Semester 6** of my **Computer Science** studies.

## Agent Systems (agent-systems)

This section includes code written in **Java** using **JADE** (for lab1, lab2, homework1) and **Python** using **Mesa** (lab3, lab4, homework2). 

- **Homework 1**: A project simulating a simple **Grocery Delivery System**. A client agent orders groceries and chooses a delivery service from a list of available options. Delivery agents interact with multiple markets to fulfill the order by selecting the best combination of prices and item availability. The system is implemented using **JADE**.

## Computer Graphics (computer-graphics/lab1)

This is a project I am currently developing for the **Computer Graphics** course. It is written in **C# WPF** (using **XAML**). 

- The app is an **image filtering tool** where users can apply various filters to an image, including:
  - Functional filters: **Invert Colors**, **Brightness Correction**, **Contrast Enhancement**, **Gamma Correction**.
  - Convolution filters: **Gaussian Blur**, **Emboss**, **Edge Detection**, **Sharpen**.
  - Morphological filters: **Erosion** and **Dilation**.
  - Dithering options: **Average Dithering** and **K-means Color Quantization**.

## Software Engineering (software-engineering-2)

This folder contains all projects related to the **Software Engineering** course. It includes:
- **TDD Kata** examples written in **C#**.
- A repository where we learned how to resolve pull requests during the labs.
- The ongoing development of a project named **DVS**, which will be linked here once completed.
